My name is Zixuan (Eleanor) Zhang, 5th year PhD candidate in Biostatistics in the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences ([PPHS](https://pphs.usc.edu/)) at University of Southern California ([USC](https://www.usc.edu/)). I am co-mentored by [Dr. Nicholas Mancuso](https://www.mancusolab.com/lab-members) and [Dr. Steven Gazal](https://gazal-lab.org/lab-members). 

My research interest focus on developing statistical approach applied in GWAS studies and QTL studies to better understand genetic architecture among human diseases and complex traits. I am currently working on a scalable computational tool (jaxQTL) for single cell eQTL mapping using GLM count-based model.

Before PhD, I graduated with a Bachelor degree in Genetic & Genomics from [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in 2018 and received Master degree in Biostatistics from [Columbia Univeristy Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/) in 2020.
