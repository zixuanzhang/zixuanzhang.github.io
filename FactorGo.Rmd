## Background 

* Biobank genome-wide association studies ([GWAS](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28686856/)) identified thousands of genetic variants associated with human phenotypic traits.  
* Pleiotropy is pervasive in genetic variants (one variant affects multiple traits) and thus provide opportunities learn shared mechanisms among human phenotypic traits through the lens of shared genetic associations.  
* [Previous work](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11953-9) proposed truncated singular-value decomposition (tSVD) on multiple GWAS summary data to characterize shared latent genetic pleiotropic factors, which uses effect sizes from GWAS significant variants without modeling effect size uncertainty. 
* We propose __FactorGO__, a factor analysis model on genetic association to account for uncertainty in effect-size estimates and leverage an automatic relevance determination (ARD) prior to control sparsity on factor loadings.

## Study overview

We constructed data matrix of Z score summmary statistics for 51,399 genetic variants among 2,483 traits from [Pan-UK Biobank](https://pan.ukbb.broadinstitute.org/). After inferring K=100 latent factors, we interpret each factor by:  
1) Fig b: quantify relative importance of trait within a factor by contribution score, as described [elsewhere](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11953-9).  
2) Fig c: test for enrichment of cell type specific functional annotation using [LDSC](https://github.com/bulik/ldsc).

## Result

### Runtime comparison

FactorGO implemented using Just-In-Time ([JIT](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jax-101/02-jitting.html)) compilation via JAX package in python under a parameter expansion method substantially improves convergence rate, which make its run time on 2-cores GPU comparable to tSVD:

### Top two factors

To look at the pleiotropic factors, we start with top 2 factors that explains most variance in the data. The first factor characterize shared co-morbidity between [Covid-19 and body weight](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7010e4.htm), basal metabolic rate that is relevant with BMI. The second factor characterize overall human growth such as height, artery measure, and body fat volume.

### Case study 1: Human height

For standing height, the most relevant pleiotropic factor is factor 2. In this factor, the leading traits are body measures such as standing height, sitting height, followed by fat-free mass measurements. These reflect the growth hormones play roles in both height growth and metabolic pathways. Moreover, this factor is enriched with genes differentially expressed in reproductive organs like Uterus and Cervix and muscular skeletal tissues like cartilage and chondrocytes , which is consistent with previous findings ([Wood et al. 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3097), [Finucane et al. 2018](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0081-4)).

### Case study 2: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

For RA, we find the most relevant factor captures quite a few trait domain including bone related traits like blood calcium level, osteoporosis (easiness of bone fracture); a known treatment for RA called methotrexate; and moreover, other autoimmune disease like IBD. Interestingly, the variants driving this factor is enriched with genes that are differentially expressed in periodontal condition and digestive system, which also reflect existing clinical evidence ([Konig et al. 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27974664/)).

## Conclusion

* FactorGO identifies pleiotropic factors while appropriately accounting for uncertainty in effect sizes under probabilistic model.  
* We applied FactorGO on 2,438 traits and 205 functional annotations to characterize pleiotropic factors.   
* FactorGO validated:  
1) shared co-morbidity between Covid-19 and BMI.  
2) shared hormonal effect in height and body fat measures.  
3) shared inflammatory mechanisms for rheumatoid arthritis.
