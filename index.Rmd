### About 

My name is Zixuan (Eleanor) Zhang, third year PhD student in Biostatistics in the Department of Population and Public Health Sciences ([PPHS](https://pphs.usc.edu/))  at University of Southern California ([USC](https://www.usc.edu/)).My research interest is developing statistical approach applied in GWAS studies to better understand shared components among human phenotypic traits. It is a real blessing to be co-mentored by Dr. [Nicholas Mancuso](https://www.mancusolab.com/lab-members) and Dr.[Steven Gazal](https://gazal-lab.org/lab-members), both of whom never run out of great ideas in the field of statistical genetics and graciously gave me strong academic support.

I graduated with a BS degree in Genetic & Genomics from [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in June 2018 and received Master degree in Biostatistics in the Department of Biostatistics at Columbia Univeristy [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/).
