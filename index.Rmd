### About 

I graduated with a BS degree in Genetic & Genomics from [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/) in June 2018 and jumped right into the master program in the Department of Biostatistics at Columbia Univeristy [Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/). 

I always love to learn and try new things in this world. My interest in data science arose from the classes I have been taking and research experiences during my undergraduate years. I came into the master program with biology background as well as some statistical knowledge and programming skills (including R and Python). A genomics lab [course](http://jnmaloof.github.io/BIS180L_web/) I took back then with [Julin Maloof](https://biology.ucdavis.edu/people/julin-maloof) at UC Davis led me into this very exciting interdisplinary field of computational biology. I wish I could obtain more skills that enable me to make sense of the data through both quantitative analysis and visualztion of various type of data.
